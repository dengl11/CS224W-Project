#### Interesting findings so far! In general, a couple of comments: Whenever you calculate a statistic, make sure to explain how that is relevant to predicting the terrorism network (ex. WCC/MxWCC stats). It is not fully clear how your particle filter based event tracking is using the network you have. Just make sure to explain that fully in your final paper. Also, please explain how you are evaluating these results and define non-standard terms such as "Vincenty distance". In addition, please evaluate the results of your SIS model in more detail. Does it perform better than other methods? Overall, good work so far. Just put a little more effort into explaining your results. Excited to see the final results of your project!
