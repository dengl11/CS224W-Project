#### **Key Player Identification**: 

- **Ref**: `0_Ref/Papers/1_Detect key players in terriorist network.pdf`
    - **Approach**: degree centrality | closeness centrality | betweenness centrality 

- **Ref**: `0_Ref/Papers/2_Analyze Terrorism Network.pdf`
    - **Approach**: plot actorsâ€™ scores for Eigenvector centrality versus Betweenness 
        - An actor with very **high betweenness but low EC** may be a critical **gatekeeper** to a central actor
        - Likewise, an actor with **low betweenness but high EC** may have **unique access to central actors**


#### Community Structure Deteection: 

- **Ref**: `0_Ref/Papers/2_Analyze Terrorism Network.pdf`
    - **Approach**: **hierarchical clustering of geodesic distance*
        - Clusters nodes together based on their distance (closer nodes clustered together)
        - Returns several possible partitions 
        - Method is both art and science


#### Uncover Terriorist Network from Known Data
